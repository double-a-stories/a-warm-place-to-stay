This is the Story Overview, from which you can find general information and statistics about your story.
</p>
<p>
Use the list at the lower-left to filter and view the passages of your story, and click on a passage to open it in review mode. While reviewing a passage, you can make changes in-place, compare your changed version to the original, revert those changes if needed, and flag a passage as reviewed to help you keep track of which passages have been reviewed and which ones remain.
</p>
<p>
You can use the links at the top left to view a change list, which shows all changes made to all passages, or export it to a file. You can also save a copy of this illumination for later use, or export your story in twee source format.

<div id="tips" style="display: none;">
<p>
Tag a passage "illumeIgnore" and it will be totally ignored by Illume for all purposes.
</p>
<p>
If a passage is not being modified, tag it "illumeReviewed" to set its initial state to Reviewed. The editor can still refer back to it if needed.

After a what feels like a wonderful eternity, she lets go. &quot;That was nice,&quot; she says, slouching down a little.

Yeah, you say, and tentatively rest your head against her shoulder.

For a little while, neither of you say anything. Ana looks over at you. &quot;Something on your mind?&quot;

You&#39;re sure of it–this is the moment where you lean in, and both share a sudden yet dramatic first kiss.

You turn toward her big furry face, and attempt to kiss her on the mouth. She immediately leans away, letting out a small, surprised growl.

&quot;Woah there, casanova, that&#39;s, uh...&quot; She frowns. &quot;I&#39;m not really comfortable with that? &quot;

Ana is visibly uncomfortable, and showing her teeth.

You reflect upon the obvious subtext of her response, and decide instead to delicately run a paw through her dark brown mohawk.

The second you touch her hair, the hyena immediately lets out an vicious bark, and reflexively glomps her mouth down over your head. You faint from surprise. Ana quickly swallows your unconscious body, making sure no one else was around to see.

You&#39;re about to say she&#39;s welcome, when Ana suddenly lunges at you and clamps her slobbering maw down over your head. Your world suddenly becomes dark, wet, and smelling faintly like mint toothpaste. True to her word, she&#39;s feisty, but not actually using teeth.

Ana deftly wraps her paws around your torso, and with a firm thrust, pushes your head, neck, and shoulders into her slimy esophagus, swallowing them almost instantly. You consider that as a hyena, maybe she&#39;s predisposed to consuming as much food as possible before someone else gets to it. Or maybe she&#39;s just experienced. Either way, the speed and ravenousness with which she traps you in her stomach is almost incredible.

Before you know it, Ana is eagerly gulping down your feet, leaving you curled up into a tight, wet ball inside her squeezing stomach walls.

&quot;BUUUURP,&quot; Ana concludes, licking her lips. &quot;How was that?&quot;

\&gt; [[...F-fast?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="...F-fast?" tags="vore" position="2679,4926" size="100,100">Ana snickers, patting the huge furry bulge you&#39;ve made in her gut. &quot;What, did you want me to &lt;%= (visited(&quot;...I don&#39;t have a dick.&quot;)) ? &quot;jill&quot; : &quot;jack&quot; %&gt; you off on the way down?&quot;

Her mention of the possibility arouses you a little. However, cramped as you are, you&#39;re fairly certain you can&#39;t quite reach your privates anymore. Curled up in the pit of the hyena&#39;s belly, you&#39;re surrounded by liquids which coat your fur, and sting your skin a little bit.

&quot;So, my little morsel, do you like it in there?&quot;

Absentmindedly, Ana sticks a paw down her jeans, and begins stroking herself. You can feel the impact of each stroke bumping against her engorged belly.

You ask her if she&#39;s jerking off.

&quot;...Yeah. I dunno why but having you in there is making me, like, *rock* hard.
&lt;% if (s.uhYeahMeNeither) { %&gt;Or, at least, that&#39;s what I *would* say, if I did have a penis, which, as established earlier, I don&#39;t.

A deal&#39;s a deal, bucko. You&#39;re hyena fat now.&quot;

You cough and choke on a little more stomach fluids. They&#39;re getting deeper, and it&#39;s gradually becoming harder to breathe.

You can only let out a small whimper.

Whatever limited air is left around you is being used up pretty fast. In response, Ana simply lets out a fierce, excited grunt as she pleasures herself. She&#39;s clearly approaching orgasm.

You&#39;re now feeling woozy and light-headed, and massively regret offering yourself as a meal. In desperation, you yell out to get the hyena&#39;s attention, but she merely growls back, &quot;Oh my god, do you ever stop whining?&quot;

&quot;Look,&quot; she grunts, &quot;I&#39;ll let you out after I orgasm, okay? Just gimme a second. I&#39;m so... freakin&#39;... close...!!!&quot;

Her eagerness even seems to increase as she realizes you&#39;re already being affected by her digestive juices.

&quot;Hnng, mmm, yeah... Right... There...&quot;

Frantically, you begin to struggle with the last remaining bit of strength you have left. You kick and stretch and thrash against the thick stomach walls which imprison you. You struggle desperately, until you can no longer. Exhaustion and the lack of oxygen are rapidly creeping up on you.

&quot;Oh my *god*, Hollis, you&#39;re squirming sooo... good...&quot; Ana&#39;s voice escalates in pitch.  &quot;I&#39;m gonna... fucking...&quot;

You shut your eyes, as you begin to dissolve into oblivion. You decide to take... just a teeny tiny nap... until...

Besides, you did agree that you wouldn&#39;t change your mind. It&#39;s your fetish, after all.

Ana lets out a relieved sigh, and resumes jerking off. &quot;Say, um, do you think you could struggle a little for me?&quot;

You don&#39;t see why not.

&quot;Woah,&quot; Ana says, letting out a surprised little moan, &quot;I love strugglers...! Mmmmph!&quot;

The already tight confines of Ana&#39;s stomach get even tighter as Ana&#39;s stomach secretes more stingy liquids. It&#39;s not painful, but it&#39;s making your fur feel a little tingly.

You tell Ana, um, you think she&#39;s starting to digest you.

Ana stifles a moan. &quot;Do you need me to let you out?&quot;

You begin to kick and squirm against the slick walls of flesh around you. You make an effort to avoid touching the pool of digestive enzymes when possible, but as they continue to flood the chamber, this becomes increasingly difficult.

Ana lets out a fierce, excited grunt in response. Her eager stroking seems to get faster as she realizes you&#39;re already being affected by her digestive juices.

You shut your eyes, and resign to fulfill your role as food. It truly is a wonderful feeling. You feel yourself beginning to drift off.

The morning sun beats down. A hung-over hyena wakes up on a bench in the Armstrongs&#39; backyard.

&quot;Ughhhh,&quot; she groans, clutching her forehead and trying to recall what exactly she did last night. She clutches her swollen middle. It&#39;s smaller than it was, but still bulging out from under her shirt. Her mind is filled with memory of the rabbit she ate last night. &quot;Ah shit,&quot; she mutters.

Ana feels guilty, somewhat. Mostly, she feels Hollis&#39;s remains snaking through her intestines, along with the encroaching need to take a massive dump. She looks towards the nearby house, but quickly rules that out as an option. It&#39;d be way too awkward to invite herself inside just to take a shit.

She wracks her brain, trying to think of the best place to squeeze her prey out.

The hyena scampers discretely through the yard, around the massive house, and onto the sidewalk. Every step makes her swollen gut squish uncomfortably. Her meal wants out, *now*. She walks to her car with the determined yet careful stride of someone who desperately needs a toilet.

Ana&#39;s car is a dinged up, ancient vehicle. She inherited it from her mother, a hyena almost as unkempt and mangy as the car. Ana&#39;s mom was a ruthless predator, and a primary reason she didn&#39;t have a father growing up. In fact, it was precisely seventeen years ago today when he was-

*Hey,* Ana thinks, *quit narrating my backstory, I need to take a shit, NOW.*

Alright, sheesh. Ana starts the car and drives for a few minutes, breathing deeply and scanning for the nearest possible location, which happens to be a Pizza Shack. She parks and power-walks inside. Upon entering, she is immediately accosted by a friendly Pizza Shack employee.

\&gt; [[&quot;Hi! Welcome to Pizza Shack!&quot;|Employee: Hi!]]

&quot;Oh goddammit, *move*!&quot; Ana shoves past the employee and makes a bee-line for the restrooms. Like most bathrooms, the toilets are segregated by size, offering one toilet each for smallerfolk (anthros under 4 feet), largerfolk (7 feet and up), and &quot;medium,&quot; all the anthros in between.

Ana, desperately holding a load of ex-rabbit inside her bowels, knocks on the medium door. &quot;Sorry, occupied.&quot;

She tries the handle for the largerfolk toilet, but it&#39;s out of service for cleaning.

*Fucking dammit,* she thinks, eyeing the smaller restroom.

\&gt; [[Ana: Poop in the tiny toilet.]]

She yanks down her pants, hovers her large ass over the toilet bowl, and immediately begins squeezing out a thick, solid turd. Her shit is mixed with gray fur and partially-dissolved bones.

The sensation of forcing digested prey out of her asshole is almost euphoric. That&#39;s partially due to how badly she needed to do it, and partially a result of her natural inclinations as a predator. She grunts, as she pushes a partially crushed skull through her asshole.

As Ana&#39;s asshole squeezes them out, Hollis&#39;s remains pile up in the small toilet bowl, well past the point at which they&#39;d be reasonable to flush. The hyena is panting softly, almost overjoyed to get her prey out of her. When the last of the shit is out, her asshole finally relaxes, and she lets loose a heavy stream of piss, splashing atop the disgusting mound of what was formerly a living, breathing person.

\&gt; [[Ana: Flush...?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Ana: Flush...?" tags="morning" position="2688,6664" size="100,100">Ana wipes her ass, stands up, and looks back.

&quot;W-wow, that was bigger than I thought it&#39;d be,&quot; she remarks. Anticipating the worst, she pushes the handle to flush. &quot;Goodbye Holly, you left me plenty of pounds to remember you buy.&quot;

The small toilet sputters, but makes no effort to swallow the massive pile of shit. It remains in the bowl.

&quot;Shit,&quot; the hyena sighs, &quot;Well, looks like you&#39;re Chet&#39;s problem now.&quot; She washes her paws, turns toward the door, and walks out with a smile on her face.

&quot;Ciao!&quot;

The world around you dissolves. The details soften, as though they were simply dark scribbles on a light background. You get the feeling that the little voices in your head are gently fading out into white noise...

You concentrate on your breathing. No wait. *Hollis* concentrates on *their* breathing. Their chest, not yours, gently rises and falls in rhythm with the drifting of the cool autumn leaves scattered around their furry feet.

my name is ana. i&#39;m a spotted hyena, currently chilling on a bench outside a vore party like a total loser.

i showed up about an hour ago, but big crowds freak me out, so i came out here to get some air and clear my head. i&#39;m here because i want to eat somebody. i want to feel prey writhing around inside my belly. i&#39;d go in there and grab one, but the noise is too overwhelming.

a rabbit walked out here a few minutes ago, and zoned out while staring at the sky. i think they&#39;re either high, or having a dissociative episode.

what do i do?

great idea, voice inside my head. i walk over to the rabbit.

&lt;span class=&quot;hollistalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Um, hi there!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; they say, clearly nervous to see me. i have that effect on people.

they flinch as i nonchalantly grab them up in my paws. &lt;span class=&quot;hollistalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Woah, wait!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; they cry out, but i&#39;m too hungry to listen. their eyes go wide as i stuff their ears into my mouth. they try to fight me at first, but eventually calm down.

with one huge gulp, i eat the rabbit.

burp. in under a minute, i&#39;ve swallowed them all up, and soon they&#39;re thrashing around inside me. a familiar fullness fills my belly, and i sigh with relief.

&lt;span class=&quot;hollistalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Y-you&#39;re gonna digest me, aren&#39;t you...&quot;&lt;/span&gt; they say.

i pat my belly and reply happily, yup!

&lt;span class=&quot;hollistalk&quot;&gt;&quot;...Alright,&quot;&lt;/span&gt; they say, settling in to their fate.

wow, this route got pretty meta, huh? whatever dumb jerk wrote this crap probably thinks they&#39;re *reeeal* clever.

You enter the downstairs bathroom, and shut the door behind you, freeing yourself from the stress of the party.

The room&#39;s every surface is flush with immaculate porcelain and gaudy gold trimmings. There&#39;s something hypnotic about it all. Your mind races with possibilities.

You take a deep breath, get your impulses under control, and...

Your libido overcomes you. In the privacy of a stranger&#39;s house, you stick your hand down your underwear and begin to pleasure yourself for a minute or two.

Satisfied, you take your hands out and stop.

Still, there&#39;s plenty of other stuff you could be doing at this party instead. This is kind of... weird?

You keep on... uh, touching yourself, for a while longer. Your heavy panting gets faster and faster, and little moans escape your lips.

Suddenly, you hear a loud pounding at the door.

&quot;You&#39;ve been in there for like 15 minutes,&quot; says an annoyed female voice through the door, &quot;I gotta fuckin&#39; pee.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; she says, &quot;I&#39;m coming in there.&quot;

\&gt; [[Orgasm!!!|Finish!!!]]

Seconds later, the door swings open to reveal a gigantic brown bear wearing a tank top and shorts. &quot;...!!!&quot;

The bear&#39;s face goes red, and she stares at you with what is clearly a combination of disgust and morbid curiosity. Suddenly though, she recognizes you. With a devious smirk, she closes the door behind her, and asks, &quot;Woah, Holly?&quot;

\&gt; [[Wait, I can explain!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="Escape through window." tags="" position="1641,2007" size="100,100">&lt;div-&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Thinking quickly, you yank your pants up, pull the nearest window open, and dive through it to safety.

Just then, the door behind you swings open to reveal Hazel Gently, a buxom brown bear.

As you clear the window sill, you look out and realize that this window is on the second story, overlooking the backyard. You faceplant gracelessly in the backyard and rapidly lose consciousness.

In your last waking seconds, you realize this was a very stupid idea.

The bear&#39;s hackles raise, and she gets a wild look in her eyes. Suddenly, you realize with horror exactly who she is. Standing across the bathroom from you is the captain of your high school&#39;s old tackle football league: Hazel Gently.

You try to explain that you&#39;re–

Thud. Before you can get a word in edge-ways, or even pull your underwear up, you feel an unbearable weight on your front, and cold tile on your back. Hazel has tackled you to the floor, and is now pinning you by the shoulders.

&quot;Well well well,&quot; she says proudly, breathing hotly onto your face, &quot;if it isn&#39;t little Holly, still masturbating in the bathroom like the freak they are!&quot;

You groan from under her oppressive mass, and try to say, actually my name is Hhh-...

She cuts you off by shifting her weight onto your wind pipe. &quot;Don&#39;t care. But I bet *you&#39;d* care a whole lot if I told everyone at this party I caught you jerking off in the bathroom like a total creep! Isn&#39;t that right?&quot;

She eventually towers proudly over your collapsed body. &quot;So. How about we make a little deal? I promise not to share the *embarassing* details of  how you jizzed yourself right in front of me, and in exchange...&quot; A twisted smile comes across her lips. &quot;I get to eat you.&quot;

\&gt; [[What? Never!]]

\&gt; [[O-okay...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="94" name="What? Never!" tags="" position="1808,2480" size="100,100">Gasping for air, you vehemently shake your head no.

&quot;Hm, really?&quot; she says, &quot;I thought you&#39;d like it! Remember that time the librarian caught you touching yourself to &#39;Keeping Them Down: Tips and Tricks for the Adolescent Predator?&#39;&quot;

Hazel reaches down and scoops you up in her arms like a baby, although her grip is almost painfully tight. She begins to carry you toward the bathroom door.

&quot;But if you&#39;re so *wildly* opposed to becoming bear shit, I guess you wouldn&#39;t mind if I brought you out there and jerked you off in front of *everybody*! I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be delighted to watch after they hear about how you creamed your jeans in Basil Armstrong&#39;s bathroom!&quot;

She gives you a smack on the ass which sends shivers down your spine.

&quot;I bet there&#39;s loads of horny critters here who&#39;d just love a piece of this bottom! I mean, assuming you just can&#39;t *stand* the thought of being dinner for dear ol&#39; Hazel...&quot;

The bear&#39;s paws clench around your skinny shoulders, and lift you effortlessly from the ground. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Holly, this&#39;ll be our little secret.&quot; She stretches her jaw wide, giving you a clear look into the undulating red flesh of her slobbering maw.

&quot;Ready to be bear-fat? Of course you are. Down the hatch!&quot;

Your face is pressed into her slobbery tongue as she effortlessly slides your head and shoulders into her maw.

&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Hazel moans as she tastes your fur. You cringe as your face is slowly squeezed into the slimy, suffocating tunnel of her esophagus. You&#39;re still wearing your top, but you feel Hazel&#39;s paws effortlessly yank your jeans off as she devours you.

You remember reading once that while their stomach acids can easily dissolve fur, flesh, and bone, bears often struggle to digest denim and leather.

The big bear handles you effortlessly, now using her paws to grip your struggling legs so you can&#39;t kick her in the face. The slimy gulping sensation continues down your neck and her throat wraps around your shoulders as well.

During your first (and only) year on the football team, you saw her use this exact technique on a wolf boy from a rival school. When she caught you watching, she called you a pervert, and threatened to do the same to you if you told anyone. She even made you lie and cover for her absence while she digested him.

You shudder to think that now you&#39;re going to become bear fat in the exact same way.

Well, it&#39;s not exactly cavernous, but there&#39;s at least enough room for you to curl up into a ball, soaking in a puddle of hot enzymes. Your hind paws slip over Hazels tongue, and she eagerly slurps them up like noodles. A gulp sends them down to their resting spot, where you and your soaking-wet t-shirt are stewing inside her hot, uncomfortable gut.

Hazel opens her mouth, and lets out an obscene, spine-rattling &quot;BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP.&quot; Hazel laughs, &quot;Whew, &#39;scuse me,&quot; and looks down at the bulge your body makes in her belly. Surprisingly, it&#39;s not a very big bulge, though this speaks more to Hazel&#39;s size than it does to yours.  You&#39;re amazed that she can still stand up on two legs with you inside her.

\&gt; [[Hazel, let me out of here!]]

&quot;Let you out? Gee, well, let me think about it... Uhhh... No.&quot;

She gives her gut a couple of firm pats, causing your prison to jiggle and bounce. You struggle and kick out against the stomach walls with all your might.

&quot;Aahh! No!&quot; she squeals, &quot;Stoppit, that tickles! Hehehe!&quot;

You&#39;re hyperventilating now, using up whatever precious bit of air is left inside her noxious gut. Reluctantly, you stop struggling.

&quot;Thank you. Now if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m *trying* to update my Snapchomp status.&quot;

That&#39;s not fair, you cry!

Her phone lets out a little celebratory chime. &quot;Woah, I got bonus tokens for eating five prey this week! I kept my streak up thanks to you. I guess I owe you one!&quot;

You optimistically ask if that means she&#39;ll let you out now.

&quot;I&#39;m *literally* rolling my eyes right now. I *have* to digest you now, or I&#39;ll lose my streak! My followers are gonna eat this up...&quot;

You say you&#39;re being serious. If she doesn&#39;t let you out you&#39;re going to die. Your eyelids are getting very, very heavy. You need to... rest your head... Hazel&#39;s massive paws gently caress the stomach walls around you, lulling your anxious mind into a light slumber.

&quot;Bye-bye Holly. You were lousy at football, but you make an excellent dinner.&quot;

&quot;Hoo-hoo!&quot; says an owl, instantly noticing the bear&#39;s belly now poking out from underneath her tanktop. &quot;Looks like somebody caught a snack! Anybody I know?&quot;

Hazel grins. &quot;Remember Hollis Freeley?&quot;

The owl gazes back down at the bear&#39;s bloated belly, and suddenly looks distraught. &quot;You bitch! I literally told you *I* was gonna eat them! I had dibs.&quot;

&quot;Sorry girl, I *had* to.&quot; Hazel turns to whisper to the owl, &quot;You&#39;ll never believe this, but I walked in on them *masturbating* in the bathroom. Like, they literally creamed their jeans right in front of me!&quot;

The owl snickers and grabs her by the arm. &quot;Hoohoohoo! Oh my god, that&#39;s insane! C&#39;mon, we gotta tell Basil.&quot;

You head up the stairs looking for your friend.

The upstairs hallway has a few doors. You can see two bedrooms: one is marked with a &quot;B&quot;, the other with an &quot;L&quot;. In between them is a small broom closet.

Where will you look?

There&#39;s no one in there. The shelves are sporting a number of trophies from various marathons and track events.

#### Items found:

* 2x Jock Strap (Extra Large)

* 1x Multi-Purpose Body Lotion (8 oz)

* 4x Adult Magazine

You close the drawer. Probably shouldn&#39;t touch any of these...

You covertly bring one of your ears to the first bedroom door. There are definitely people inside. You can hear a muffled moaning.

What do you do?

\&gt; [[Knock politely on the door.]]

\&gt; [[Ignore it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="Knock politely on the door." tags="" position="897,2225" size="100,100">&quot;Um, go away,&quot; says a male voice from inside the room.

Alongside it, you hear a few more muffled grunts, as well as a kind of slick slurping noise. Is someone... swallowing?

\&gt; [[Ignore it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Ignore it." tags="" position="1026,2226" size="100,100">Sounds like it&#39;s just people having sex. You should probably leave them alone.

You swing the bedroom door open, and enter. There are three people in the room.

You see a cream-colored mare sitting on the bed, with a huge bulge in her throat. Beside him is a German shepherd, who is gently caressing the horse&#39;s stomach.

The third person, you realize, is your friend Reese. The guinea pig&#39;s head and shoulders are sticking out of the horse&#39;s mouth as she swallows him. All three of them look at you with surprise.

&quot;Woah, what the fuck?&quot; asks the dog.

&quot;Hollis!?&quot; cries Reese.

The horse swallowing Reese suddenly smiles. &quot;Ohmigod, Holly!&quot; You recognize her: it&#39;s Lacey Armstrong, the girl who had volunteered to tutor you in math.

\&gt; [[Do something!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="Do something!" tags="" position="967,2477" size="100,100">Your friend is being devoured before your very eyes. You know you&#39;ve got to save him, but you hesitate. Under the pressure, your body freezes up.

&quot;You know them?&quot; asks the dog.

&quot;I&#39;w expfain lafer,&quot; says Lacey.

You can see Reese&#39;s neck slowly disappearing into the mare&#39;s slick pink gullet. &quot;Hollis,&quot; he calls, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me! I&#39;ll be fi-mmph.&quot; His voice becomes muffled as Lacey gulps hard, and pulls Reese&#39;s head fully into her mouth.

The dog stands up in a threatening manner.

What will you do?

\&gt; [[Attack Lacey!!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="115" name="Attack Lacey!!" tags="" position="968,2603" size="100,100">&quot;No, don&#39;t!&quot; cries Reese from inside the horse&#39;s throat.

Adrenaline rushes through your veins. You sidestep the dog, and fling yourself full force at the horse&#39;s bulging stomach, perhaps hoping to dislodge your friend via the Heimlich maneuver. Unfortunately, your small size makes this effort completely ineffective.

&quot;Woah!&quot; the dog says as you harmlessly slam against his girlfriend&#39;s gut, &quot;Someone&#39;s eager to join their friend!&quot; You fall backward, stunned, and he wraps his big paws around your shoulders. &quot;What do you think, Lace,&quot; he says, &quot;Got room for another?&quot;

Lacey gives one last forceful swallow. You watch in horror as the bulge made by Reese&#39;s head drifts down her throat and disappears into the writhing bulge in her middle. &quot;Sure do,&quot; she smiles.

\&gt; [[Struggle.|Struggle against Lacey.]]

\&gt; [[Let her eat you.|Let Lacey eat you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="116" name="Struggle against Lacey." tags="" position="1016,2727" size="100,100">You try to resist, but the dog only grips you tighter, and begins to undress you, presumably to make you easier on the stomach. He then lifts your naked body effortlessly into the air, and positions your bare feet in front of Lacey&#39;s awaiting maw.

Lacey looks over your naked body with a bit of pity. &quot;Oh Hollis, I&#39;m real sorry for eating you. Vore just makes me *sooo* horny... And your friend&#39;s already squirming *soo* good inside me.&quot; She licks her lips. &quot;Plus, you kinda owe me for helping you get that A in Calculus.&quot;

Lacey opens her quivering pink maw wide, and says, &quot;Anyway, buh-bye!&quot;

\&gt; [[Gulp.|Lacey noms ur legs.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="117" name="Let Lacey eat you." tags="" position="903,2722" size="100,100">You stop resisting, and go limp against Lacey&#39;s engorged belly. The dog stops forcing you against it.

&quot;Huh, this kid&#39;s smarter than I thought!&quot; he says, now lifting you towards the horse&#39;s awaiting maw. Lacey smiles.

&quot;It&#39;s great to see you Holly! So thoughtful of you to be my dessert.&quot;

&quot;Oh Hollis, it&#39;s so sweet of you to go willingly! I promise I&#39;ll digest you and your buddy as painlessly as possible.&quot; She licks her lips. &quot;Oh, and thanks for sharing your math homework with me!&quot;

She opens her mouth wide. The dog positions your bare feet in front of her awaiting maw. He smiles. &quot;Time for dessert, babe!&quot;

\&gt; [[Gulp.|Lacey noms ur legs.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="118" name="Lacey noms ur legs." tags="vore" position="953,2845" size="100,100">Your legs slide effortlessly into Lacey&#39;s mouth. It&#39;s almost like entering a sleeping bag, if that sleeping bag were extremely hot and wet. Your fur feels impossibly slimy. Lacey lets out little snorts and moans as more and more of your body slips into her throat.

The dog watches with fascination and arousal; his girlfriend has already pulled you in up to your chest, then your neck, until only your head is sticking out of her mouth.

Lacey&#39;s boyfriend looks at your exposed head and smiles while unzipping his trousers.
&quot;Now, whaddya say we give our friend here a little goodbye present?&quot;

\&gt; [[Absolutely not!|Refuse Clif&#39;s dick.]]

\&gt; [[Suck his dick.|Don&#39;t refuse Clif&#39;s dick.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="119" name="Refuse Clif&#39;s dick." tags="vore" position="880,3073" size="100,100">You vehemently shake your head in protest.

The dog sighs. &quot;Okay, jeez, I was just asking. Suit yourself.&quot; He sits on the bed next to Lacey, and begins to caress and massage her bloated stomach. &quot;Looks like your appetizer has already settled down a good bit! You&#39;re a real champion, Lace.&quot;

Lacey continues dillegently slurping and swallowing you down.
You feel your feet beginning to enter her stomach, bumping against a hard object which you can only assume is your unfortunate friend. Only your head and shoulders are still protruding from her lips; your body is paralyzed by the powerful muscles of her throat her throat.

\&gt; [[Mmmph...|Lacey finishes swallowing.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="120" name="Don&#39;t refuse Clif&#39;s dick." tags="vore" position="1049,3059" size="100,100">You remain silent as Lacey pulls you in further. Now only your head and shoulders are sticking out of her mouth. Obligingly, you open your mouth. The dog smiles.

&quot;Allow me to introduce myself,&quot; he says, slowly bringing his erection closer to your mouth. &quot;The name&#39;s Clif, and this is my girlfriend Lace. I&#39;m the dog who&#39;s gonna destroy your tonsils.&quot;

Lacey sees what her boyfriend is doing, and rolls her eyes with a little chuckle. She stops her swallowing, and you barely have time to take a breath before-

*Glk.* Without warning, you feel Clif&#39;s enormous rod plunge against your lips, into your throat. Your mouth instantly coats his meat with saliva. His tip is practically dripping with salty pre, and you can do nothing but savor it. His thick, furry balls slap against your snout.

\&gt; [[Swallow his cock.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="121" name="Swallow his cock." tags="vore" position="1044,3164" size="100,100">&quot;Woah, this kid&#39;s a natural! Mmmmh!&quot;

He moans in delight, spending a few seconds merely impressed that you were able to swallow his full length all in one go. However, his torment doesn&#39;t end there. Clif eagerly begins to slide his cock in and out of you. The motion quickly evolves into a rhythmic thrust. Each time he hilts in your mouth, you feel yourself getting pushed deeper inside Lacey&#39;s throat, until her lips are wrapped around your chin.

&quot;Oh fuck,&quot; he moans, grabbing hold of your ears. &quot;I&#39;m gonna... fucking...&quot;

\&gt; [[Spurt.|Clif jizzes in your mouth.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="122" name="Clif jizzes in your mouth." tags="vore" position="1046,3287" size="100,100">&quot;...!!!&quot;

Clif grips his cock, and sticks his tip between your lips. Spurt after spurt of warm jizz pumps into your mouth and paints your throat. He lets out a series of eager grunts and gasps as he empties his load into you, and you can tell he&#39;s resisting the urge to knot your mouth. You swallow reluctantly. Slowly, and with great satisfaction, he withdraws himself.

&quot;Man,&quot; he pants with a smile, &quot;part of me regrets letting you digest this talented little cockslut!&quot; He gently pats Lacey&#39;s face. &quot;Part of me, anyway. They&#39;re all yours, Lace.&quot;

Lacey lets out a happy noise, and opens her mouth wide.

\&gt; [[Mmmph...|Lacey finishes swallowing.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="123" name="Lacey finishes swallowing." tags="vore" position="956,3423" size="100,100">Your arms are pinned to your side. Lacey&#39;s gullet is squeezing tight around your body. You can&#39;t move. You couldn&#39;t fight back if you tried.

All you can do now is shut your eyes and hope this is all a dream. But you don&#39;t wake up. Instead, you feel Lacey stretch her mouth out wide, and...

*Glomp.* Your vision goes dark. You feel her lips clamp down over your ears. Lacey&#39;s mouth has engulfed your whole head. She moans with delight. You feel yourself sinking deeper and deeper into her gullet.

\&gt; [[Let me out...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="Let me out..." tags="vore" position="957,3530" size="100,100">You cry out in vain, but nothing slows your slimy descent. You take a deep breath before the slimy tunnel of her throat slides over your neck, and eclipses your nose. For several seconds, you are unable to see or breathe. All you can hear are the sounds of Lacey gulping down your ears, accompanied by her thundrous heartbeat, and the squelching of her innards.

You can feel your legs pressing into Reese&#39;s naked fur, as Lacey&#39;s stomach effortlessly stretches to accomodate you. The tight accomodations means your body is forced to curl up against his. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, your head is deposited along with the rest of you inside the horse&#39;s belly.

&quot;Oh, hey Hollis,&quot; says Reese, naked and squeezed tightly against you. &quot;...I think your ass is in my face.&quot;

\&gt; [[Reese, what happened?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="125" name="Reese, what happened?" tags="vore" position="956,3652" size="100,100">You try to reposition yourself, to no avail. Lacey&#39;s stomach is hugging you tightly. Your voice is muffled a little by what you now realize is the fur of his tail. Unwittingly, the two of you are sixty-nining.

You ask Reese how the hell he got here.

&quot;Okay, so, I&#39;m grabbing some punch, right? And who do I bump into but Lacey from Math Club, and her hunky boyfriend! We catch up, and it turns out they&#39;re both like, *super* into vore. They invite me upstairs and we start fooling around... Then she offered to digest me, and I was like, &#39;Hell yes!&#39;&quot;

You blink in astonishment. He said *yes*??

&quot;Of course! Why do you think I came here?&quot; he pauses for a moment, and shifts uncomfortably. &quot;...You wanted to get eaten too, right?&quot;

\&gt; [[No! No I did not!|I did not come here to be digested!]]

\&gt; [[I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting to!|I did not come here to be digested!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="126" name="I did not come here to be digested!" tags="vore" position="951,3760" size="100,100">&quot;...R-really? Then why did you agree to come along with me? I thought I told you there&#39;d be preds here.&quot;

You remind Reese of his exact words. He told you the party would be, and you quote, *crawling with drunk hotties just begging for a taste of you.*

He pauses. &quot;...I see now how that could be misinterpreted. So, you&#39;re *not* a vore fetishist? I guess I just always assumed you were a closeted Softie, or a Demi-Dissolver. Sorry, that&#39;s what we call people with non-fatal digestion fantasies.&quot;

So all that stuff from before... was just roleplaying?

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he replies, &quot;all purely consenting fun. Well, except for the part where she ate you. I think she mistook your resistance for playfulness?&quot;

\&gt; [[I need to get out of here!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="127" name="I need to get out of here!" tags="vore" position="961,3876" size="100,100">Reese sucks air through his teeth. &quot;That&#39;s... not really an option.&quot;

What? You scramble indignantly, trying to get your friend&#39;s crotch out of your face for a second.

&quot;It&#39;s... kind of an unspoken rule among Dissolvers? No means yes. Lacey wouldn&#39;t let us out even if we asked her to. And it&#39;d be rude to deprive her of a meal.&quot;

Exasperated, you ask Reese, doesn&#39;t she have some kind of *safe word*?

Reese hesitates. &quot;Well um, we *would*, but these two are really into hardcore regurgitation denial,&quot; he says. &quot;Like, scenarios where the prey get swallowed, then suddenly change their mind and beg to be released, but the pred still digests them... Clif told me about it, I think it&#39;s actually pretty sexy.&quot;

You roll your eyes. He&#39;s taking the whole &quot;being digested&quot; thing pretty well.

\&gt; [[...So what happens now?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="...So what happens now?" tags="vore" position="960,3996" size="100,100">Reese stretches a little against the tight, wet stomach walls around the two of you.

&quot;Now, we digest. A big pred like Lacey should be able to completely convert our bodies to nutrients within about 7 hours.&quot;

You ask, will that be painful?

&quot;Oh no, we&#39;ll pass out long before then. I&#39;d say we&#39;ve got about fifteen minutes of oxygen left between us? At least, judging by what I&#39;ve read.&quot;

You sigh. Despite your approaching demise, the warm cocoon of Lacey&#39;s belly is actually somewhat calming. In a way, it feels like you&#39;re fulfilling your purpose as a rabbit. You&#39;re starting to see the appeal of this kind of thing...

\&gt; [[...And until then?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="...And until then?" tags="vore" position="962,4116" size="100,100">Lacey&#39;s stomach lets out a little grumble. Reese shudders; you can tell the noise makes him a little excited. He tries to reposition himself, to no avail. The two of you remain stuck in a ying-yang of brown and gray fur.

&quot;Well, I was hoping I&#39;d have a little more room in here...&quot; Reese says, and spends a moment thinking. &quot;This is gonna be kind of a dumb question, Hollis... But do you wanna suck *my* dick?&quot;

\&gt; [[...Yeah, okay.|Suck Reese&#39;s dick.]]

\&gt; [[Nope.|Don&#39;t suck Reese&#39;s dick.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="Suck Reese&#39;s dick." tags="vore" position="908,4237" size="100,100">&quot;Sweet,&quot; he says, spreading his legs as much as the stomach will allow. &quot;I really owe you one Hollis. You&#39;re the best prey-pal a guy could ever ask for.&quot;

It doesn&#39;t take much work at all to get Reese&#39;s dick into your mouth;  you&#39;d practically been avoiding it this whole time. Its size is nowhere near as threatening as the dog&#39;s was.

Mm. You delicately tease your friend with your tongue. He throbs a little in response. If being moments from digestion in a beautiful horse girl&#39;s stomach hasn&#39;t already done it, he&#39;s completely erect now.

&quot;Nnnnnh,&quot; he moans, almost involuntarily. It&#39;s very cute. &quot;Hol, I&#39;m gonna...!!&quot;

\&gt; [[Swallow his jizz.|Swallow Reese&#39;s jizz.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="Don&#39;t suck Reese&#39;s dick." tags="vore" position="1023,4288" size="100,100">&quot;Oh, duh,&quot; he says, clearly a little embarassed. &quot;Sorry I asked.&quot;

You tell him no problem. You&#39;d imagine you&#39;d probably want to get off before being permanently digested as well. You feel yourself getting lightheaded.

For a little while, Reese doesn&#39;t say anything. &quot;Sorry I got you into this mess, Hollis.&quot;

You tell him not to worry about it; the whole thing was an almost comically absurd level of miscommunication.

Lacey&#39;s stomach grumbles eagerly around you. You now feel yourself getting very sleepy. The last thing you feel is a kind of reluctant contentment, before drifting into a peaceful rest.

\&gt; [[Lacey: Digest.|Lacey: Digest.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="Lacey: Digest." tags="" position="985,4483" size="100,100">Outside, Lacey gently caresses the hard masses of meat filling her stomach.

&quot;They stopped moving,&quot; she says, smiling and letting a burp escape her lips.

Clif eagerly presses his paws into his girlfriend&#39;s engorged belly, feeling for Reese and Hollis&#39;s softening outlines. &quot;Do you think they&#39;re done in there?&quot;

Lacey touches her gut. &quot;Guess so,&quot; she says, &quot;but they were nice while they lasted.&quot;

Clif grins, hugging his girlfriend, &quot;Clearly no match for my powerful predator, though, huh?&quot;

She lets out another satisfied burp, and kisses him. &quot;Oh, stop.&quot;

&quot;Mmmmm!&quot; he moans, as his cock spends several seconds erupting with warm semen, which you gulp down. He pants eagerly, likely using up a ton of your air, before finally settling down. &quot;Th-thanks Hol,&quot; he murmurs, attempting to pull his dick out of your mouth, and instead smearing your face with cum. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he snickers.

For a little while, Reese doesn&#39;t say anything. You&#39;re getting a little lightheaded now. Finally, he speaks up. &quot;Sorry I got you into this mess, Hollis.&quot;

You tell him not to worry about it. You feel yourself getting very sleepy. Lacey&#39;s stomach grumbles eagerly around you. The last thing you feel is a kind of reluctant contentment, before drifting into a peaceful rest.

Lacey awakens to find that she has slightly outgrown her bra and pants. Clif rolls over in his sleep, still snoring loudly. As the mare rises to her feet, she feels a familiar rumbling in her gut.

Lacey looks down at her dramatically shrunken belly, and recalls the night before. &quot;Phew,&quot; she remarks, &quot;What a night!&quot;

The two aren&#39;t hard to pass, just a little time-consuming.

Lacey feels her asshole squeeze out the last glob of leftover rodent, then clench shut with relief. She muses to herself that they were easier coming out in than they were to get out! Especially the rabbit, who squirmed way too much...

Lacey Armstrong yawns and stretches, ready for a new day, full of new meals. Soon, she&#39;d forget all about those the two delicious meals who comprised her last bowel movement.

You enter the broom closet.

&lt;div style=&quot;min-height: 6em&quot; id=&quot;broom-closet-text&quot;&gt;
Inside is a shelf with some towels, linens, and some cleaning supplies. Leaning against the wall is a broom and a vacuum cleaner.

After wasting an inordinate amount of time doing absolutely nothing, you rationally decide that yes, it is now finally time to leave the broom closet.

You turn to the door and reach for the handle, only to realize that there isn&#39;t one. The broom closet only opens from the outside. Whoever designed this tiny, pointlesss room apparently did not expect that anyone would ever be stupid enough to walk inside and close the door behind them.

You&#39;re trapped, numb-nuts. I didn&#39;t even know that was possible.

%&gt;

You bang on the door trying to get someone&#39;s attention, but with the loud music going on downstairs, no one can hear you. As a result of this incredibly stupid turn of events, you remain trapped in the broom closet for the rest of the night. Congrats, I guess, on finding the dumbest ending ever.

Elsewhere in the house, the morning sun comes blazing through the windows, and lands warmly on the cream-colored fur of a horse, lying in bed while her boyfriend snores loudly next to her. Lacy Armstrong stretches and yawns as she climbs out of bed, her guts filled with the digested remains of a guinea pig. Specifically, the remains of your friend, a guinea pig named Reese.

Lacey enters the hallway, and opens the broom closet to grab some clean bedsheets. She blinks groggily, as her brain takes a moment to register the unexpected presence of a gray rabbit, curled up and sleeping on the floor.

She laughs. &quot;Wait a minute, is that... Hollis?&quot;

You slowly and look up at the horse, who is beaming at you with a big smile. &quot;Hey there! Remember me? It&#39;s Lacey, from Calc II!&quot;

Instinctually, you try to leap to your feet and escape, but Lacey lightly places a foot (er, hoof, actually) on your stomach, keeping you in place.

&quot;Sorry, can&#39;t have you running off now. Usually I&#39;d appreciate some breakfast, but I&#39;m kinda full right now...&quot;

You breathe a sigh of relief, as you realize she&#39;s not going to eat you. Then, you hear a German shepherd come out into the hall, wearing nothing but his boxers. &quot;Hey Lacey,&quot; he says rubbing his eyes, &quot;who ya talking to?&quot;

Lacey smirks as the dog notices you, and says, &quot;...My *boyfriend* on the other hand, would absolutely *love* a taste!&quot;

(¯- w •¯)|Oh, is my tail giving you ideas?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="167" name="Agree to let Basil eat you in the living room." tags="" position="3751,3930" size="100,100">Something inside your head is screaming at you to run, begging you to not to succumb to such a pointless fate. Maybe the punch is messing with your head. But right now, all you can think about is the wet, hot flesh inside this horse&#39;s slobbery mouth.

You nod your head again. Unconsciously, your tail starts wagging.

Basil rises to his feet, a pleased, benevolent smile on his face. He removes his jacket to reveal a gray tank-top, a few shades lighter than your fur. &quot;Alright then &lt;%= visited(&quot;My name&#39;s Hollis?&quot;) ? &quot;Hollis&quot; : &quot;Holly&quot; %&gt;,&quot; he says, &quot;Prepare to be horse-food.&quot;

\&gt; [[Strip naked.|Undress in the middle of the party.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="168" name="Undress in the middle of the party." tags="" position="3748,4048" size="100,100">You attract the attention of a few onlookers as you suddenly shuck off your clothes, and drop them on the floor. You hear a few whoops and hollers. Soon, nearly the whole crowd in the living room is looking at you with anticipation, murmuring eagerly amongst themselves.

Basil towers over you. A bit of his drool drips on your left ear, causing you to twitch. You&#39;re sure you can make out a bulge in his trousers. &quot;Huh,&quot; the horse says, sneaking interested glances at your naked body, &quot;All this time I thought you were... Nevermind.&quot; He licks his lips and says, &quot;Let&#39;s give these folks a show!&quot;

The stallion grips you by the shoulders and stretches his mouth wide open. Your last thing you see are his flat white teeth, framing the inviting entrance to his gullet.

\&gt; [[Basil: Glomph.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="169" name="Basil: Glomph." tags="vore" position="3748,4165" size="100,100">The party disappears, and your surroundings are swiftly replaced by the darkness of Basil&#39;s mouth. Your ears are immediately soaked in saliva, and you feel them tickling the back of this throat.

&quot;Mmmmf,&quot; Basil moans out loud. He runs his powerful tongue over your face, tasting you and coating your face in hot drool.

A dozen strangers watch in awe as the massive horse swallows you.

&quot;Woooh,&quot; calls a labrador, &quot;Armstrong finally found a snack!&quot;

&quot;Total cutie of a meal!&quot; remarks an owl.

&quot;God, I wish that was me,&quot; sighs a black mouse.

Their voices become muffled as your ears are gulped into the horse&#39;s throat, followed by your head, neck, and shoulders. You can make out the crowd chanting in unison—&quot;Gulp! Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!&quot;—as if spectators on a particularly hedonistic sport.

\&gt; [[Become horse food.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="170" name="Basil: Digest." tags="" position="3720,5675" size="100,100">Basil pats his belly with a satisfied smile on his face, and takes a seat in a chair while his belly gurgles and groans with the telltale sounds of a digesting prey.

&quot;Yaaaaawn,&quot; he yawns, pressing and squeezing on his swollen gut as it slowly softens up, gradually dissolving whatever is left of the rabbit.

Around him, the scene is a bit chaotic. Following his lead, the room has erupted into a flagrant display of sex and devourment. Clothes and full-bellied predators scatter the room. The few remaining prey are either hiding atop furniture, or actively being seduced by their peckish peers. Those with a penchant for neologism might call it a vorgy.

Some watch enviously as a black mouse&#39;s tail is slurped up between the lips of a hungry dragoness. Meanwhile, a drunk labrador burps up the clothes of one of his friends. A lioness restrains a Shih Tzu girl&#39;s shoulders while her friend swallows her feet-first.

Basil smiles as the party rages on. Another night well planned.

### The End.

&quot;Hnnnnnng~,&quot; he moans, sitting on the comfortably stallion-sized toilet in his house. His asshole clenches as he squeezes out plop after plop of shit. The putrid globs of horse-turd almost fill the massive toilet bowl, but are soon flushed away by its powerful plumbing. Whatever&#39;s left of Hollis that wasn&#39;t absorbed onto the horse&#39;s body goes unceremoniously racing into the sewers.

&quot;Phew,&quot; Basil says, squeezing his abdomen, &quot;I&#39;m glad I only ate one last night, otherwise my figure would be completely wrecked.&quot; He walks to the living room, to observe the resultant wreckage from last night&#39;s rager.

Unsurpsingly, the living room is a complete mess. The floor is scattered with plastic cups and a couple of passed-out predators. Basil grabs a trash bag, and starts to clean up the trash.

As he&#39;s nearing the entertainment center, he realizes that his sister&#39;s gaming console (a GameStation 4 Pro, to be precise) is missing. The AC adapter has been ripped straight out of the wall, probably by some drunk opportunistic thief.

&quot;Ugh,&quot; he groans, &quot;I turn my back for one freakin&#39; minute...&quot;

### The End.

\&gt; [[Restart.|Start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="172" name="Become horse food." tags="vore" position="3746,4282" size="100,100">Over the next three minutes or so, Basil slowly but eagerly works your body down his throat and into his belly. You feel yourself gliding effortlessly through the slick tunnel of his gullet, towards your tight, hot destination. He&#39;s done this before, hasn&#39;t he?

A few furs in the room keep watching with wide eyes as they witness an act of predation for the first time. Others begin shamelessly touching themselves, and others still begin to survey their peers for potential meals.

\&gt; [[Curl up in Basil&#39;s belly.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="173" name="Moan." tags="vore" position="3743,4531" size="100,100">Basil laughs, the kind of chuckle which makes his belly squeeze in on you slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot;

The insides of Basil&#39;s stomach are spacious and warm. You&#39;re curled up in a loose ball, but you have enough room to get comfortable surrounded by the undulating flesh. Even though you specifically asked him to do this, you&#39;re still surprised by how aroused it&#39;s making you. First time for everything, after all.

The stallion pats your outline and asks, &quot;Say, d&#39;ya think you can squirm around in there for me?&quot; Every time you move slightly, he lets out a satisfied little grunt.

You consider could probably take the opportunity to &quot;enjoy yourself&quot; a little...

\&gt; [[Enjoy yourself.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="174" name="Enjoy yourself." tags="vore" position="3741,4657" size="100,100">You do that. You&#39;re already naked, so you take the opportunity to rub yourself in a pleasing way. The comfy, slimy walls squeeze and squish around you, resisting and conforming to your every movement. It&#39;s incredible.

&quot;Woah,&quot; Basil grunts, &quot;That feels great! Never had a prey masturbate inside me before...&quot;

Meanwhile, Basil&#39;s display seems to have inspired a few other budding predators to also nab a meal. Surprisingly, most of the prey in the room seem pretty amenable to their fate, probably because that&#39;s exactly what they came here for.

Basil too is attracting some attention, something you realize when you feel two pairs of hands pressing against your outline in his stomach.

\&gt; [[What&#39;s going on out there?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="175" name="What&#39;s going on out there?" tags="vore" position="3736,4793" size="100,100">Back outside, a pair of black mice have asked permission to touch Basil&#39;s bulging gut. You feel them curiously poking and prodding you, stifling little giggles and gasps as you twitch and move in response. &quot;Woooah,&quot; one of them says, &quot;This is *soo* hot. Hope it likes being horseshit!&quot;

Basil winks at the black mouse, &quot;Stick around, and maybe you&#39;ll join them for the afterparty!&quot; They both squeal and scamper off giggling.

\&gt; [[Wait, horseshit?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="176" name="No thank you. (Basil)" tags="" position="3885,3524" size="100,100">&quot;...Oh. Of course,&quot; Basil says, awkwardly. He stands, and turns to leave. &quot;Just uh, be careful out there, alright?&quot; He starts to walk away.

Basil walks away, back into the throng of dancing partygoers.

\&gt; [[Return to the Foyer|The Foyer.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="177" name="Well, as long as you don&#39;t digest me..." tags="" position="3744,3681" size="100,100">Basil smiles again. &quot;You&#39;ve got yourself a deal, Freeley.&quot;

The stallion rises to his feet, a pleased, benevolent smile on his face. He yanks off his jacket to reveal a gray tank-top. A few people take interest, and look your way.

&quot;Alright then &lt;%= visited(&quot;My name&#39;s Hollis?&quot;) ? &quot;Hollis&quot; : &quot;Holly&quot; %&gt;,&quot; he says, &quot;Prepare to be horse-food.&quot;

\&gt; [[Strip naked.|Undress in the middle of the party.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="178" name="Curl up in Basil&#39;s belly." tags="vore" position="3744,4406" size="100,100">The sphincter to his esophagus shuts tightly, as your hind paws come sliding into his stomach after you. Basil&#39;s full belly effortlessly stretches to contain the entirety of your curled up body, leaving a massive bulge sticking out of his previously flat and chiseled stomach.

&quot;BRAAAAAAAP,&quot; the stallion concludes, wiping his mouth with the neck of his tank top, which has long since given up on containing his swollen belly. He pats his gut happily. &quot;How&#39;s it going in there?&quot;

\&gt; [[Moan.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="179" name="Wait, horseshit?" tags="vore" position="3736,4921" size="100,100">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Basil chuckles, &quot;should only take me a few hours, really! I&#39;ll probably be squeezing you out into a toilet by this time tomorrow.&quot;

\&gt; [[You&#39;re... gonna digest me?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="180" name="You&#39;re... gonna digest me?" tags="vore" position="3737,5039" size="100,100">Basil gives you an affirmative pat. &quot;Uh, you know how this works, right? Did you think I was just gonna keep you in there forever? &quot;

&lt;% if (visited(&quot;Well, as long as you don&#39;t digest me...&quot;)) { %&gt;

You cry out to say he said he wouldn&#39;t digest you!

&quot;Oh, I did promise that, didn&#39;t I... Well, it&#39;s not like I can let you out now. It&#39;d be gross.&quot;

&lt;% } else { %&gt;

N-no, you stammer, you assumed he&#39;d let you out.

&quot;Well,&quot; he says, patting his gut with a happy belch, &quot;You know what happens when you assume: I make an ass out of you.&quot;

&lt;% } %&gt;

\&gt; [[Struggle.|Struggle inside Basil!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="181" name="Basil: Get me out of here!" tags="vore" position="3800,5430" size="100,100">The lack of oxygen is making you dizzy. You bang helplessly on the walls of the horse&#39;s stomach, begging to be let out.

&quot;No, sorry. I get that you&#39;re new to this, but once you&#39;re in there, you&#39;re not coming back up.&quot;

B-but you&#39;re friends, you insist! He can&#39;t just digest you!

&quot;Friends? C&#39;mon, we talked like, twice while my sister taught you math.&quot;

Money! You have money, you tell him!

&quot;I dunno if you&#39;ve seen my house, but I&#39;m *really* not that susceptible to bribery.&quot; He pokes your outline. &quot;Jeez, you&#39;re really taking your time in there. Most meals woulda softened up by now. And I&#39;d *reeally* like you to stop talking now.&quot;

You&#39;re too light-headed to respond. You&amp;nbsp;need to rest, you decide, before you can struggle any more. Just a short nap. You close your eyes, and drift off into oblivion.

&quot;Nothing else to say? Phew, finally...&quot;

\&gt; [[Basil: Digest.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="182" name="This is kinda hot..." tags="vore" position="3679,5367" size="100,100">Basil pats your bulging outline. &quot;It is right? Glad you changed your mind. It must be nice knowing you&#39;re contributing to my sweet bod.&quot;

Either because of the oppressive heat in here, or the lack of air, you feel yourself body begin to relax. You resume pleasuring yourself, now finding a strange arousal in the idea of being digested. You&#39;re going to die, but somehow, that hardly even matters to you?

Mmmmn, you moan out.

&quot;You really like it in there, huh?&quot; Basil laughs. &quot;That&#39;s good, cause that&#39;s your new home!&quot; His stomach acids are beginning to tingle your fur, and it&#39;s getting tougher to breathe.

You pant with excitement, knowing that you&#39;re nothing but food.

\&gt; [[Hollis: Cum.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="183" name="Struggle inside Basil!" tags="vore" position="3729,5187" size="100,100">You kick out at Basil&#39;s stomach walls.

&quot;Oooh, yeah, just like that,&quot; he says, either oblivious to, or completely ignoring the fact that he&#39;s about to digest you.&quot; Your world shakes nauseously as the horse grabs his gut, and sloshes it around a little. You&#39;re suddenly covered in stinging stomach acid.

&quot;Y&#39;know, you prey like to whine about becoming shit, but they never consider how *we&#39;re* affected. I&#39;m gonna have to hit the gym every day next week to get my six-pack back after what you do it.&quot;

Your struggling only increases. The juices are beginning to tingle your fur, and it&#39;s getting tougher to breathe.

\&gt; [[Get me out of here!|Basil: Get me out of here!]] *(Unwilling Digestion)*

\&gt; [[This is kinda hot...]] *(Willing Digestion)*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="184" name="Hollis: Cum." tags="vore" position="3677,5489" size="100,100">You masturbate inside Basil&#39;s stomach, your movements gradually becoming faster and more furious.

A few people outside are gawking and pointing at the motion coming from Basil&#39;s gut. He simply replies with a cocky smile. &quot;Heh. You&#39;ve really putting on a show for us, huh?&quot; He rubs his gut, sloshing you with more stomach acid. &quot;Time to soften up now.&quot;

The stingy liquids splash all over you, but you don&#39;t care. It&#39;s exactly what you needed to climax. You hold your breath, and finally orgasm. Waves of pleasure wash through every part of your body. Basil&#39;s stomach squeezes tightly around you, coating you in more and more acid.

Just as the ecstasy begins to wane, you suddenly pass out.

\&gt; [[Basil: Digest.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="185" name="Go to the garage." tags="todo" position="4800,1400" size="100,100">You walk down the hall and enter the garage. Parked inside is a clean and polished pickup truck from a luxury brand, and a similarly ostentatious boat.

A few feet ahead of you, you see a red fox, who appears to be struggling to carry a huge cardboard box. Stacked haphazardly on top is a number of objects, including some electronics, a game console, two silver candelabras, and what appears to be an oil painting of a sakura tree. The fox notices you.

&quot;Oh, hi there, cutie!&quot;

\&gt; [[Ask him what he&#39;s up to.]] *(Male Pred)*

\&gt; [[What&#39;s she doing?]] *(Female Pred)*</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="186" name="...What are you doing?" tags="" position="4800,1625" size="100,100">You ask &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;him&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; what &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt;&#39;s doing.

&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; smiles and replies, &quot;Stealing!&quot;

Huh, yeah, you guess that was pretty obvious.

&quot;You showed up with perfect timing!&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; says, gesturing with &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; bushy tail towards the truck, &quot;Could you unlatch the tailgate for me?&quot;

\&gt; [[Is that a good idea?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="187" name="Is that a good idea?" tags="" position="4800,1775" size="100,100">&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; looks confused. &quot;It&#39;s a *great* idea? I&#39;ve always wanted this stuff!&quot;

You meant ethically speaking. Won&#39;t the folks who live here be upset about this?

&quot;The horses who live here are loaded. They won&#39;t even notice it&#39;s gone!&quot;

And what if &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; gets caught?

&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; smiles, &quot;That sounds like a problem for Future Ren! ...My name&#39;s Ren, by the way.&quot;

You&#39;re Hollis, you reply, scratching your ears nervously.

&quot;Charmed!&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; says, carefully balancing the almost cartoonishly large pile of stolen goods, &quot;Anyway, I could use some help with that latch. Any time now!&quot;

\&gt; [[Help with the latch.|Help Ren.]]

\&gt; [[Don&#39;t.|Don&#39;t help Ren.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="188" name="Help Ren." tags="" position="4748,1941" size="100,100">*CW: Auto theft. Car chase. Hostage situation.*

You can&#39;t fault &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; logic. Well, you can, but you also don&#39;t want to get on &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; bad side. You walk over and unlatch the tailgate,&amp;nbsp;so Ren can load &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; pile of loot onto the flatbed.

&quot;Phew,&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; says, closing it up again, &quot;I owe ya one!&quot;

Ren suddenly grabs you into a warm hug, affectionately wrapping &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; tail around your whole body for a moment, before releasing you as if nothing happened.

N-no problem, you stammer!

&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; walks around to the driver&#39;s side door, &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; tail already wagging with the excitement of a successful heist.

\&gt; [[Is this your truck?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="189" name="Don&#39;t help Ren." tags="" position="5150,2075" size="100,100">*CW: Violent threat. Unwilling vore. Bad breath.*

You don&#39;t assist &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;him&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt;, instead choosing to carefully back toward the door, so as not to seem complicit in &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; theft. If anyone asks, you were just looking to get some fresh air, when you stumbled upon this eccentric kitsune stealing a load of valuables. It&#39;s the perfect alibi, you think, because it&#39;s completely true.

Ren struggles to keep the box steady. &quot;Trunk... Now... Please? I&#39;m in kind of a pickle here, and if you don&#39;t, I&#39;m... gonna... Ack!&quot;

\&gt; [[Continue.|Ren drops the boxes.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="190" name="Go for a ride." tags="" position="4724,2458" size="100,100">You climb into the passenger seat, enjoying the luxuriant feeling of its upholstry, which seems to be made of faux leather. You&#39;re not sure why car manufacturers go to such lengths to imitate tanned cowhides, or why any of them actually know what cow skin would even feel like. The very idea strikes you as rather barbaric.

Ren pushes a button which opens the garage door, then pushes another button which starts the engine/ It comes to life with an obedient purr.

&quot;Say, where do you live?&quot; Ren asks.

You punch your address into the car&#39;s dashboard computer.

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not far. Let&#39;s cruise for a little while first!&quot;

You&#39;re not sure that&#39;s such a good idea, but you&#39;re also in no place to stop &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;him&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt;.

You can&#39;t&amp;nbsp;just abandon him, not at a party full of preds!

&quot;Oh, your friend&#39;s totally in a belly by now,&quot; Ren says.

What? You ask &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;him&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; how &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; knows.

&quot;Call it a hunch,&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; says, &quot;No prey ever came to a party like this expecting to leave in one piece, right? Everyone&#39;s either here to eat or get eaten.&quot;

You didn&#39;t realize this was that kind of party, you say.

Ren smirks, &quot;Then it sounds like you could use a ride home.&quot;

You nod.

\&gt; [[Go for a ride.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="192" name="Hollis: Escape." tags="" position="5175,2325" size="100,100">You&#39;re not fast enough. With the swiftness of a ninja, Ren leaps at you and grabs you by the middle. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; bares &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; teeth.

&quot;This is your fault,&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; seethes, &quot;You were about to go tell on me, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

No! You cry out, you&#39;re not gonna tell anyone! Promise!

&quot;Horsecrap!&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; says, bringing &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; sharp teeth right up against the exposed fur of your neck. This is a obscene gesture, uncommon among civilized anthros. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; growls, &quot;Gimme one good reason I shouldn&#39;t eat you right now.&quot;

Your body is frozen. In the heat of the moment, flushed with fear, you try to reply. Your lips quiver but don&#39;t form words.

&quot;Whoops,&quot; Ren says, licking saliva from &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; lips, &quot;Too slow.&quot;

\&gt; [[Ren: No witnesses.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="193" name="Is this your truck?" tags="" position="4748,2068" size="100,100">Ren hops into the driver&#39;s seat, sniffs around a bit, and jingles a set of keys that was stashed in a cup-holder. &quot;It is now!&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt;  laughs,  &quot;Wanna take it for a little spin?&quot;

Ren glomps &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; lips over your head, and begins working to squeeze it into &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; throat. You try to squirm free, but &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;he&#39;:&#39;she&#39;%&gt;&#39;s gripping your body too tightly.

You look up at your destination, and wince slightly. The fox&#39;s &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; pulsating throat keeps blasting you with hot, putrid air. &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;He&#39;:&#39;She&#39;%&gt; seems to be hyperventilating as &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;he&#39;:&#39;she&#39;%&gt; eats you.

\&gt; [[Try persuasion?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="195" name="Ren: Getaway." tags="" position="4728,2604" size="100,100">The fox gets a cocky smile on &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; face, and peels out like a race car driver. The truck, as if it knows it&#39;s being stolen, begins playing some fast rock music. Or maybe it was just tuned to this station.

As Ren pulls out onto the main road, you look in the rear-view mirror, and see &lt;%=localStorage.talkedToBasil?&#39;Basil&#39;:&#39;a stallion&#39;%&gt; standing in the garage, bewildered.

Um, you say, you think the horses who live here noticed.

&quot;Psh,&quot; Ren says, &quot;We&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

For a little while, the two of you drive on through the dimly lit streets between suburbs. You drive past your old high school, then the Pizza Shack, then the shopping mall which shut down last year. Your mind flickers with faint memories of all the years you spent growing up here, yet strangely, it all feels foreign. It&#39;s as if tonight is the first night you&#39;ve truly lived.

Ren pulls onto the highway, experimentally speeding and pushing the limits of the vehicle&#39;s motor. A constant grin is plastered on &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; face. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt;&#39;s truly in &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; element.

Then you see red and blue lights coming from the car behind you.

\&gt; [[Oh crap, the fuzz!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="196" name="Oh crap, the fuzz!" tags="" position="4728,2734" size="100,100">&quot;Oh my gosh,&quot; Ren laughs, &quot;this isn&#39;t an 80&#39;s action movie, you don&#39;t need to call them the f-&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt;&#39;s interrupted by sirens.

You immediately start panicking. Why on earth did you think was a good idea?? Suddenly the truck&#39;s console lights up with a phone call from an unknown number. You&#39;re sweating bullets as you tentatively answer.

A menacing voice comes through the speakers. &quot;Hello, this is State Trooper Jackson Stephanides, requesting that you pull over the stolen vehicle.&quot;

You look in the rearview mirror and confirm that the car behind you is a highway patrol vehicle with its lights on. It&#39;s being driven by two enormous warthogs.

\&gt; [[(oh shit oh god oh shit oh fuck.)]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="197" name="Ren: Floor it!!!" tags="" position="4728,2996" size="100,100">Ren puts &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; foot down. You&#39;re pulled back against your seat as the car rapidly accelerates.

Oh shit shit shit, you groan. You can&#39;t believe this is happening. You look to Ren for assurance. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; grins and mouths the words, &quot;so cool, right?&quot; You&#39;re gonna be sick.

&quot;WE REPEAT,&quot; Stephanides&#39;s partner bellows into the phone, &quot;PULL OVER. I AM AUTHORIZED TO USE DEADLY FORCE.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t shoot!&quot; Ren replies with equal ferocity, pushing the truck up to its top speed. &quot;I have a hostage! I have kidnapped an innocent rabbit, and I will be devouring him if my demands are not met!&quot;

Your world spins, and it takes all your might not to simply crumple into a nervous ball. The fox gestures for you to back &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;him&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; up. You whimper into the phone, Th-that&#39;s right! You&#39;ve been kidnapped by a scary fox. Don&#39;t shoot!

\&gt; [[]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="198" name="(oh shit oh god oh shit oh fuck.)" tags="" position="4728,2860" size="100,100">You&#39;re pretty sure you know when to cut your losses. You tell Ren that &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; should slow down.

&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; doesn&#39;t slow down. Instead, &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; replies, &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t catch that! Who is this again?&quot;

&quot;I repeat, this is State Trooper Jackson Stephanides,&quot; he says, &quot;We received an anonymous tip that a vehicle with this license plate number was stolen from a residence 15 minutes ago. Please. Pull. Over.&quot;

The fox considers for a second. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; seems to be doing some mental calculations, and you wonder if she&#39;s about to turn the two of you in. &quot;Stephanides, huh?&quot; &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt; says, pausing for effect, &quot;...More like Stephani-deez nuts!&quot;

You hold your face in your paws. Stephanides is silent for a moment, then he says into his radio, &quot;This is 119 at 805, I am in pursuit of a 10-29, requesting immediate assistance.&quot;

\&gt; [[Ren: Floor it!!!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="199" name="Ask him what he&#39;s up to." tags="" position="4725,1525" size="100,100">&lt;% s.rm = true; %&gt;

You take in a big lungful of putrid air and hold it. Your head slides into the tight tube with a wet slick sound.

Ren is pretty big for a fox, but not the biggest fur you&#39;ve seen here. You get the feeling &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;he&#39;:&#39;she&#39;%&gt;&#39;s somewhat struggling to devour you. Still, this doesn&#39;t prevent &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;him&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; from swallowing both your head and shoulders in a single powerful GULP.

Don&#39;t do this!" tags="vore" position="5300,2700" size="100,100">You open your mouth to squeal one last plea for mercy. Unfortunately, you do this just before the fox gulps your head into &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; throat, and wind up inhaling a mouthful of saliva. You cough and wheeze uncomfortably. Your head slides into the tight tube with a wet slick sound.

The fox lets out a low growl. You realize &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; teeth are now positioned directly around your throat, and &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;he&#39;:&#39;she&#39;%&gt; could easily bite your head off if so inclined. You rationally decide to keep your mouth shut from now on. &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;He&#39;:&#39;She&#39;%&gt; responds with a happy murr, and swallows again, so your shoulders fill &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; cheeks.

Your face is moments from sliding into &lt;%=s.rm?&#39;his&#39;:&#39;her&#39;%&gt; gullet.

\&gt; [[Take a deep breath.]]

Don&#39;t do this!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="205" name="Why not?" tags="" position="4648,2184" size="100,100">You seriously consider &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt; offer. You had reservations at first, but the more you think about it, the more excited you are to partake in a high-stakes getaway as this strange fox&#39;s unwitting accomplice.

Besides, you really don&#39;t want to be the only one here when someone notices everything that&#39;s missing.

\&gt; [[Wait, I shouldn&#39;t leave my friend...]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="206" name="That seems like a bad idea..." tags="" position="4770,2186" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="207" name="Ren drops the boxes." tags="" position="5175,2200" size="100,100">&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; loses &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;his&quot;:&quot;her&quot;%&gt;  balance and drops the box, sending all of its contents crashing to the ground, including a fine porcelain teapot and a GameStation 4 Pro. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt; watches helplessly as they smash into several pieces.

&lt;%=s.rm?&quot;His&quot;:&quot;Her&quot;%&gt;  ears and whiskers droop with defeat. &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;He&quot;:&quot;She&quot;%&gt;  looks like &lt;%=s.rm?&quot;he&quot;:&quot;she&quot;%&gt;&#39;s about to cry.

Taking this as your cue to leave, you twist the knob to the garage door. Just as you do, Ren growls, &quot;Don&#39;t move. I&#39;m not done with you.&quot;
