You gesture to the frozen dinner machine, and offer to buy Zasha something to eat.

As if reacting to the mere mention of food, <%=s.g?"his":"her"%> stomach lets out a low grumble. Geez, now you're afraid of what might have happened if you hadn't asked.

"Yes," says Zasha, "I suppose I have not eaten much today at all." <%=s.g?"He":"She"%> studies the machine for a moment, then points to the meal <%=s.g?"he":"she"%> wants.

You feed your cash in, and the machine gracefully ejects a large plastic tub: Lemon Risotto with Green Beans and Salmon. As a vegetarian, you can't help but turn up your nose slightly.

You take the container, and follow the enormous bear into Room 7. Zasha is unabashedly wagging <%=s.g?"his":"her"%> stubby white tail, as if utterly overjoyed at your simple gesture of buying <%=s.g?"him":"her"%> dinner.

You and Zasha have a pleasant meal. Zasha shares <%=s.g?"his":"her"%> green beans with you. The two of you learn more about each other, laughing, and enjoying the night. You admit to Zasha that at first, you were worried <%=s.g?"he":"she"%> would eat you! <%=s.g?"He":"She"%> laughs and dismisses the thought.

Zasha offers to share the tiny bed with you, and you feel comfortable enough around <%=s.g?"him":"her"%> to oblige. You cuddle cutely, and fall asleep.

The next day, you awake to find Zasha's arms wrapped tight around you. You wake up and blush, but <%=s.g?"he":"she"%> realizes the time. <%=s.g?"He":"She"%> needs to get on the road to make it to <%=s.g?"his":"her"%> next gig.

As <%=s.g?"he":"she"%> drives you back to your car, you're relieved to see that (a) the snow has melted, and (b) your car is still there. Zasha tows you to a repair shop. You say your farewells to Zasha, who gives you <%=s.g?"his":"her"%> number, and you offer to call. You pull back onto the road, and continue with your trip. Kiss, and wave goodbye.

### The end.
